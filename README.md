My Pig-Game 
</br>
GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</br>
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score</br>
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</br>
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn</br>
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game</br>
